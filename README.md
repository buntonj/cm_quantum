Undergraduate project to compute the wavefunction of a particle within a 3D Gaussian potential well by solving the wave equation PDE.  Uses [Boole's Rule](https://www.scipress.com/BSMaSS.2.1.pdf) to numerically integrate the partial differential equation.
Computes the three-dimensional wavefunction of an electron inside a three-dimensional Gaussian potential well.  For details and results, check out [the report!](https://github.com/buntonj/cm_quantum/blob/main/quantumprojreport.pdf)
